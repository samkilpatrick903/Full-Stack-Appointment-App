# Project_2

## Description
 The interaction between a doctor and patient starts by booking an appointment. Our application makes that easy! As a user looking to schedule an appointment with a chiropractor our website allows the user to create an account that gives them access to schedule. After creating the account the user will be presented with our appointments page where they can easily choose the date, time, location, and doctor they wish to see. As a user they also have the ability to write a description of their issue for the doctor they will be seeing. When the user is done scheduling they can log out by clicking the "Logout" button at the top of the page. The user also has the ability to log back in using the email and password they created when signing up if they wish to update, delete, or create an appointment.
